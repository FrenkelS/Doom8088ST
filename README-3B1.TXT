Doom8088 for AT&T UNIC PC computers
https://github.com/FrenkelS/Doom8088ST

Doom was originally designed in 1993 for 32-bit DOS computers with 4 MB of RAM.
It's mostly written in C code with very little assembly code.
It has been ported to all kinds of systems.
Usually these systems are 32-bit or more and have a flat memory model.

Doom8088: AT&T UNIX PC Edition is a port for AT&T UNIX PC computers with at
least 512 kB of RAM (1 MB recommended) and a Motorola 68010 CPU.
It's based on Doom8088, a port of Doom for 16-bit DOS computers.
